## Module 2 Project 1 - Relational Rails
This purpose of this project was to begin working with Rails, one-to-many relationships (areas being one, climbs being many in this case), ActiveRecord, MVC, and ORM. 

Project utilized TDD for both features and models with the assistance of rspec-rails, capybara, and shoulda-matchers.

In the future, this project could be expanded by adding more robust HTML/CSS for better views, addition of images of areas/climbs on views, and possibly plotting areas on a map based on the latitude and longitude values assigned to them.

### **Learning Goals**
<ul>
    <li>Design a one to many relationship using a schema designer</li>
    <li>Write migrations to create tables with columns of varying data types and foreign keys</li>
    <li>Use Rails to create web pages that allow users to CRUD resources</li>
    <li>Create instance and class methods on a Rails model that use ActiveRecord methods and helpers</li>
    <li>Write model and feature tests that fully cover data logic and use behavior</li>
</ul>

### **Requirements**
<ul>
    <li>Must use Rails 5.2.x</li>
    <li>Must use PostgreSQL</li>
    <li>Must “handroll” all routes (no use of resources syntax)</li>
</ul>
